# sitemap-gazer

[README 中文版](README.zh.md)

A tool that helps you easily monitor website changes.

It crawls sitemaps, saves them locally, compares with the previous crawl, and generates a README report for easy viewing. It supports monitoring multiple sitemaps in a single report.

It can also run in a GitHub Actions workflow: [hackerqed/sitemap-gazer-example](https://github.com/hackerqed/sitemap-gazer-example)
